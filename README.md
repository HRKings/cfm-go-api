# CFM Go API

The official CFM API is SOAP based, which make it difficult to use and integrate in other applications and services.

This simple wrapper aims to solve this issue by providing a method that can call the SOAP API and return an usable response that can be converted to any other format.

**Keep in mind that to use the API an access token is required.**
